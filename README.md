# Tableau-Electric_Vehical_Analysis_Dashboard-

ðŸ“Š Project Overview:

This project showcases an interactive dashboard designed to analyze electric vehicle (EV) adoption across the United States. Using a combination of SQL, Excel, and Tableau, the dashboard provides key insights into EV trends, distribution by make and model, and geographic adoption patterns.


ðŸ›  Technologies Used:

SQL: For querying and cleaning the raw dataset.

Microsoft Excel: For preliminary data exploration, aggregation, and formatting.

Tableau: For creating an interactive and visually compelling dashboard.


ðŸ“Œ Key Features:

Total EV Count: Overview of total EVs, split by BEV (Battery Electric Vehicle) and PHEV (Plug-in Hybrid Electric Vehicle).

Average Electric Range: Aggregated mileage analysis across all vehicles.

EV Distribution by Year: Line chart highlighting the yearly trend of EV registrations.

Top 10 Vehicle Makes and Models: Visual ranking of popular EV brands and models.

Geographic Analysis: US map showing vehicle distribution by state.

CAFV Eligibility Breakdown: Donut chart categorizing vehicles based on Clean Alternative Fuel Vehicle eligibility.


ðŸ“ˆ Insights:

Tesla dominates the EV market with over 50% of the vehicles.

Steady growth observed post-2016, peaking in 2023.

Washington state leads with the highest number of EV registrations.

Most vehicles are BEVs, accounting for over 77% of the total.


ðŸ’¡ Data-Driven Recommendations (Based on Your Dashboard):

Tesla is the Clear Leader

Holds over 50% of EVs in your dataset. Models Y, 3, and S are top 3.

Suggests strong consumer trust, resale value, and infrastructure support.

Model Y and Model 3 are Most Popular

Consider recommending Model Y for families/SUV needs and Model 3 for personal or urban use.

Washington is a Hotspot

States like Washington, California, and Florida lead EV adoption â€” better infrastructure, charging stations, and incentives likely available.

BEVs > PHEVs

Battery electric vehicles (BEVs) make up 77.62% of the total â€” recommend going full electric unless long rural drives are common.


ðŸš€ Outcomes:

This dashboard aids stakeholders, policymakers, and EV manufacturers in:

Understanding EV adoption trends.

Identifying leading brands and models.

Analyzing regional market performance for strategic planning.
